## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
function setInput(key, value) {
setFormState({ ...formState, [key]: value })
}
async function fetchTodos() {
try {
const todoData = await
API.graphql(graphqlOperation(listTodos))
const todos = todoData.data.listTodos.items
setTodos(todos)
} catch (err) { console.log('error fetching todos') }
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is for developers and tech companies looking to develop cloud-native products rapidly with the AWS ecosystem. Web and mobile developers with little-to-no experience in TypeScript programming will also find this book helpful. Although no prior experience with AWS or TypeScript is required, basic familiarity with modern frameworks such as React and React Native is useful.
